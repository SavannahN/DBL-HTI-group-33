				<h1>Help Page</h1>
                The tool in this stage is not very user friendly. It is still posible to make "wrong" choices. <br>
                The only data that is able to be used is our fixation dataset. The option to upload your own datasets is not yet supported.<br>
                The usage of the site itself is you have 3 dropdown menus where you can pick a map, user and tool from.<br>
                There are user and map combination that won't show anything this means that there is no user data for that map.<br>
                After hitting the submit button it may take a few seconds before you get a response please be patent and do not close the tab in that time.<br>
